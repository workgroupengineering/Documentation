# Viewbox

The `Viewbox` is a decorator control which scales its child. It can be used to scale its child to fit the available space.

Though it can be used for any kind of control, it is often used to scale 2D images to a given space.

The `Viewbox` gives its child infinite space in the measure phase. It will constrain either or both sides when aranging it. This depends on the Value of the `Stretch` property.

Here is an example of a button scaled up to fit the given space. Without the `Viewbox` the button would have been rendered at around 22 dip height. With the `Viewbox` it will be displayed with a height of 300 dip:

```text
<!-- button will occupy 22 dip under usual font sizes and dpi setting -->
<Button Content="Text"/>  

<!-- this button will be much larger -->
<Viewbox Stretch="Uniform" Height="300">
	<Button Content="Text"/>
</Viewbox>
```
