# Creating a View

Let's first create a view to display a list of TODO items together with a button to add a new item.

Because this is a first tutorial, we're going to first just populate the view with some hard-coded data. In later steps we'll use the MVVM pattern to populate this view.

Our view is going to be a `UserControl`.

### Create the UserControl <a href="create-the-usercontrol" id="create-the-usercontrol"></a>

We're going to create the `UserControl` from a template. Follow the instructions below:

#### Visual Studio <a href="visual-studio" id="visual-studio"></a>

1. Right click your project's `Views` folder in Solution Explorer
2. Select the `Add -> New Item` menu item
3. In the dialog that appears, navigate to the "Avalonia" section in the category tree
4. Select "User Control (Avalonia)"
5. Enter `TodoListView` as the "Name"
6. Click the "Add" button

#### .NET Core CLI <a href="net-core-cli" id="net-core-cli"></a>

Run this command from the root directory of your project (the directory that contains "Program.cs" and the "Views" directory):

```
dotnet new avalonia.usercontrol -o Views -n TodoListView  --namespace Todo.Views
```

### The UserControl <a href="the-usercontrol" id="the-usercontrol"></a>

The template should create a XAML file with the following contents in the `Views` directory, alongside `MainWindow.axaml`

```markup
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
             xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
             mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="800" d:DesignHeight="450"
             x:Class="Todo.Views.TodoListView">
    Welcome to Avalonia!
</UserControl>
```

Alongside the XAML, you will also find a `TodoListView.axaml.cs` file containing the code-behind for the view (in Visual Studio this is nested under the XAML file so click the expander next to the XAML file in Solution Explorer to see it):


```csharp
using Avalonia;
using Avalonia.Controls;
using Avalonia.Markup.Xaml;

namespace Todo.Views
{
    public partial class TodoListView : UserControl
    {
        public TodoListView()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }
    }
}
```

We're not going to touch the code-behind file for a little while, but notice that the class is called `TodoListView` and it's located in the `Todo.Views` namespace.

### Edit the UserControl <a href="edit-the-usercontrol" id="edit-the-usercontrol"></a>

Edit the contents of `Views/TodoListView.axaml` to contain the following:

```markup
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
             xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
             mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="200" d:DesignHeight="300"
             x:Class="Todo.Views.TodoListView">
  <DockPanel>
    <Button DockPanel.Dock="Bottom"
            HorizontalAlignment="Center">
        Add an item
    </Button>
    <StackPanel>
      <CheckBox Margin="4">Walk the dog</CheckBox>
      <CheckBox Margin="4">Buy some milk</CheckBox>
    </StackPanel>
  </DockPanel>
</UserControl>
```

If you're using the Visual Studio extension you should see the contents of the control displayed in the previewer after completing a build:

### What does it all mean? <a href="what-does-it-all-mean" id="what-does-it-all-mean"></a>

Lets take a look at the code we just entered line-by-line.

```markup
<UserControl xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
             xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006">
```

The root element in the XAML is `UserControl` as could be expected. This is followed by a bunch of `xmlns` declarations. Each of these declares an XML namespace but the most important one is the first one: `xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"` - this declares that the XAML in the file contains Avalonia XAML; without this entry nothing will work.

The next XML namespace is `xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"`. This is used to import XAML features that aren't specific to Avalonia. We'll be seeing this in use later.

The following two namespaces are used to communicate designer-specific information, which is specified next:

```markup
mc:Ignorable="d" d:DesignWidth="200" d:DesignHeight="300"
```

`mc:Ignorable="d"` tells the XAML engine that entries beginning with `d:` can be ignored and you can pretty much ignore it too!

The `d:DesignWidth="200"` and `d:DesignHeight="300"` attributes tell the XAML designer to display the content with a size of 200x300 pixels. They're ignored at runtime.

```markup
x:Class="Todo.Views.TodoListView"
```

This line tells the XAML engine where the class that accompanies the XAML can be found. It's the fully-qualified name of the class. Note that this attribute is prefixed with `x:` - this relates to the `xmlns:x` entry we saw earlier.

Ok, that's the boilerplate out of the way! Now onto the meat of the code:

```markup
<DockPanel>
```

First we add a `DockPanel` as the child of the `UserControl`. A `UserControl` can only contain a single child so often the child is one of Avalonia's panel controls. `Panel` controls are special in that they can have multiple children.

`DockPanel` is a type of panel which lays out its controls at the top, bottom, left and right sides, with a single control filling the remaining space in the middle.

```markup
<Button DockPanel.Dock="Bottom" HorizontalAlignment="Center">Add an item</Button>
```

Now we declare the `Button` that appears at the bottom of the view. The `DockPanel.Dock` attribute tells the containing `DockPanel` that we want the button to appear at the bottom. `HorizontalAlignment` centers button in the middle of the parent. As the element content we set the button text: `"Add an item"`.

```markup
<StackPanel>
```

Next we add another panel: a `StackPanel`. `StackPanel` lays out its child controls - surprise - in a stack. By default it lays out the controls vertically, but you can also make it lay out controls horizontally by setting the `Orientation` property, e.g. `<StackPanel Orientation="Horizontal">`.

Because this is the last child in the `DockPanel` it will fill the remaining space in the center of the control.

```markup
<CheckBox Margin="4">Walk the dog</CheckBox>
<CheckBox Margin="4">Buy some milk</CheckBox>
```

Last of all, we add two `CheckBox` controls to represent the TODO items. We're also giving the controls a margin to separate them a little bit visually.

### Display the view in the Window <a href="display-the-view-in-the-window" id="display-the-view-in-the-window"></a>

To see the view we've just created, we need to add it to the application's main window. Open the `Views/MainWindow.axaml` file and edit it to have the following content:

Views/MainWindow.axaml

```markup
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
        xmlns:views="clr-namespace:Todo.Views"
        x:Class="Todo.Views.MainWindow"
        Icon="/Assets/avalonia-logo.ico"
        Width="200" Height="300"
        Title="Avalonia Todo">
  <views:TodoListView/>
</Window>
```

A lot of this is similar to the markup we've already seen, so lets just look at the interesting parts:

```markup
xmlns:views="clr-namespace:Todo.Views"
```

We want to display the `TodoListView` control we just created, which is in the `Todo.Views` C# namespace. Here we're mapping the `Todo.Views` namespace to the `views` XML namespace. Any control that is not a core Avalonia control will generally need this type of mapping in order for the XAML engine to find the control.

```markup
<views:TodoListView/>
```

Using the XML namespace we've just declared we now place the `TodoListView` control as the content of our `Window`.

### Run the application <a href="run-the-application" id="run-the-application"></a>

If you now run the application (by pressing `F5` in Visual Studio or executing `dotnet run` in .NET Core) you should see the application running in all its glory:
