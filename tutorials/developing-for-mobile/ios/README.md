# iOS

In this section we describe how to setup you machine for iOS development. Then if you have a mac how to run it on a simulator or an actual iPhone or iPad.

{% hint style="info" %}
Due to Apple's policies it is unfortunately not possible to run the iOS simulators or test on an iPhone or iPad without a genuine Apple device running MacOS and XCode.\
\
We hope this might change in the future, if you do not have access to MacOS a  workaround is to run your application in a Window sized appropriately. Or follow the guides on Android.\
\
You should always test on a real device before releasing.
{% endhint %}



Before getting started ensure you have followed the guide [create-a-cross-platform-solution.md](../create-a-cross-platform-solution.md "mention").
